### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ï¼Œ I am Alex Chen, Chinese.

In my spare time, I like to learn some math, but I also know some cryptography, C/C++, Java, Golang. Currently, I am probably more concerned about Rust, and I am currently working in the blockchain field, and my wish is to build my own Infra with Rust, such as database, blockchain or other similar cryptography libraries.

#### Project

* [mpvss-rs](https://github.com/AlexiaChen/mpvss-rs)ï¼šRust language project, the only amateur and blockchain-related PVSS cryptography library, with technical content, reference to the implementation of a paper, their first Rust work, previously advertised in the Rust Chinese community (with an introduction), https://rustcc.cn/article?id=f43b1eb0-6b3d-456a-b609-b1cdb5be689f , plus tests and examples, about 1000+ lines of Rust, the subsequent consideration of continued iterative optimization.

* [computaion-theory](https://github.com/AlexiaChen/computation-theory)  mainly to achieve some computational theory-related demos, such as NFA, DFA and semantic aspects, it has been a long time since I studied PL itself, but I may pick it up to continue writing.
