### Hi there 👋， I am Alex Chen, Chinese.
 
 Read and write lots of code, clone existing things as exercises, learn deeply.  - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/735315594262745088)
 
 Most of my programming career has involved finding something neat, writing my own version to understand it & often throwing it away. - [Edward Kmett](https://twitter.com/kmett/status/738675156583866370)
 
 I program those "clones" like I read papers: change a core part; redesign it. Gain progress or understanding why it is what it is. - [Edward Kmett](https://twitter.com/kmett/status/738675988972834817)
