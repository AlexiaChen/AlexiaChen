 Read and write lots of code, clone existing things as exercises, learn deeply.  - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/735315594262745088)
 
 Most of my programming career has involved finding something neat, writing my own version to understand it & often throwing it away. - [Edward Kmett](https://twitter.com/kmett/status/738675156583866370)
